# ðŸ”“ ZipCracker - Python Zip Password Cracker

This project demonstrates how to crack password-protected `.zip` files using Python. It uses a brute-force dictionary attack by testing a list of potential passwords (wordlist) against the ZIP archive.

Supports both:
- Standard ZipCrypto-encrypted ZIP files (Python's built-in `zipfile`)
- AES-encrypted ZIP files (via `pyzipper`)
